# Pima CC CIS265 Week #6 Project B

(a) Write a program that reads a message, then prints the reversal of the message:
```text
   Enter a message: Don’t get mad, get even.
   Reversal is: .neve teg .dam teg t’noD
```
 Hint: Read the message one character at a time (using getchar) and store the characters in an array. Stop reading when the array is full or the character read is '\n'.
 
(b) Revise the program to use a pointer instead of an integer to keep track of the current position in the array.

Notes:
* This is version (b) using a pointer.
* Compiled with MS Visual Studio 2017 Community (v141), using C language options.
